# Sprinkler Layout Tool Requirements

## 1. Purpose

The sprinkler layout tool shall allow a user to load a scale drawing of a yard, calibrate that drawing to a real-world measurement, and place sprinklers accurately in that scale. The tool shall visualize sprinkler throw coverage with arcs, highlight overlap density so users can see where coverage is weak or excessive, and collect basic hydraulic inputs needed to assess whether a proposed layout is feasible.

## 2. Goals

- Enable accurate sprinkler placement on top of a yard plan or site drawing.
- Preserve real-world scale so throw distances and spacing are meaningful.
- Make coverage easy to interpret visually, especially overlap count.
- Collect supply line size and pressure as required project inputs.
- Support practical residential yard planning workflows.

## 3. Non-Goals

- Full hydraulic simulation for friction loss across every branch and fitting.
- Automatic pipe routing or trench planning in the first version.
- Automatic wire routing or valve wiring generation, controller programming, or irrigation scheduling.
- Plant-specific watering recommendations beyond sprinkler coverage layout.

## 4. Primary Users

- Homeowners planning a new sprinkler system.
- Contractors creating rough irrigation layouts for customers.
- Designers validating sprinkler spacing and coverage on residential properties.

## 5. Core User Stories

- As a user, I want to import a yard drawing so I can design on top of an existing plan.
- As a user, I want to calibrate the drawing to a known measurement so all distances are accurate.
- As a user, I want to place sprinklers at exact positions on the scaled drawing.
- As a user, I want each sprinkler to display its throw arc so I can see covered areas immediately.
- As a user, I want overlap areas to appear darker or denser so I can identify under-watered and over-watered spots.
- As a user, I want to enter supply line size and pressure so the design reflects available water conditions.
- As a user, I want to adjust sprinkler properties such as radius and arc angle so I can model different heads and nozzles.
- As a user, I want to move, rotate, or delete sprinklers so I can iterate on the layout quickly.

## 6. Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Project Setup

- The system shall allow the user to create a new layout project.
- The system shall allow the user to load a background drawing or image of the yard.
- Supported drawing/image formats should include at minimum `PNG`, `JPG`, and `PDF` if feasible.

### 6.2 Scale Calibration

- The system shall allow the user to define the drawing scale after import.
- The system shall support two-point scale calibration by letting the user click two points on the drawing and enter the real-world distance between them.
- The system should optionally support four-corner image rectification for photographed plans by mapping a known rectangular reference area into a corrected rectangle before scale calibration.
- The system shall convert on-screen distances into real-world units after calibration.

### 6.6 Overlap Density Visualization

- When two or more sprinkler coverage areas overlap, the overlapping region shall be visually darker or otherwise denser than single-coverage regions.
- The overlap visualization shall work through layered transparency or an equivalent method that makes coverage count easy to interpret.
- The visual system shall make at least these states distinguishable:
- No coverage.
- Single coverage.

### 6.7 Hydraulic Inputs

- The system shall require entry of supply line size for each project.
- The system shall require entry of available supply pressure for each project.

- The system shall validate that supply pressure is a positive number within a reasonable range.
- The system shall allow editing of hydraulic inputs after project creation.
- The system shall display hydraulic inputs in the project summary.

### 6.8 Basic Feasibility Guidance

- The system shall use supply line size and pressure as project constraints for layout review.
- The first version shall at minimum warn the user that available pressure and line size affect the number of heads that can run per zone.
- The system should provide informational guidance when a selected sprinkler radius appears unrealistic for the entered pressure.
- If full hydraulic calculations are not implemented, the interface shall clearly state that hydraulic feasibility is advisory, not guaranteed.

- The scale calibration workflow shall be easy to discover immediately after drawing import.
- The interface shall make it clear whether the drawing is calibrated.
- The interface shall display real-world dimensions rather than only pixel distances.
- The sprinkler placement workflow shall require no more than a few actions:
- Select sprinkler type.
- Click to place.
- Adjust radius and arc.
- The overlap visualization shall remain readable over varied background drawings.
- The user shall be able to adjust overlay opacity if the background drawing becomes hard to read.

## 9. Validation Rules

- The baseline target should support at least 100 placed sprinklers while maintaining usable interaction performance on a typical desktop browser.

## 11. Accessibility Requirements

- Overlap density shall not rely solely on color differences; opacity, shading, pattern, or legend cues should also help interpretation.
- Controls shall be keyboard accessible where practical.
- Text and controls shall maintain readable contrast.
- Units and numeric values shall be presented clearly and consistently.

## 12. Assumptions

- The imported yard drawing is sufficiently accurate for scaled layout work.
- Users know at least one real-world dimension on the plan for calibration.
- Hydraulic inputs are supplied manually by the user.
- The first version focuses on 2D planning rather than terrain elevation analysis.

## 13. Risks and Open Considerations

- Overlap darkening based purely on alpha compositing may become difficult to interpret at high overlap counts; a capped scale or legend may be needed.
- PDF import may require rasterization or a separate rendering pipeline.
- Hydraulic guidance can be misleading if users assume it replaces full irrigation design calculations.
- Different sprinkler manufacturers have different throw characteristics, so default radius behavior must be clearly user-controlled.

## 14. Acceptance Criteria

- A user can import a yard drawing and calibrate it using a known distance.
- A user can place sprinklers and see their throw arcs rendered to scale on the drawing.
- Moving or editing a sprinkler updates the throw visualization immediately.
- Overlapping coverage areas become visibly darker or otherwise denser as overlap count increases.
- A user must enter supply line size and supply pressure as part of project setup or review.
- Saved projects reopen with the same drawing, scale, sprinkler placements, and hydraulic inputs intact.
- The exported layout clearly shows sprinkler positions and coverage arcs on top of the yard drawing.

## 15. Recommended Future Enhancements

- Zone grouping and valve assignment.
- Pipe routing assistance.
- Manufacturer nozzle libraries.
- Pressure loss estimation by zone and pipe run.
- Coverage analysis for lawn polygons only, excluding hardscape and buildings.
- Automatic head-to-head spacing suggestions.
- Mobile and tablet field markup support.
